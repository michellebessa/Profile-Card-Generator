## üå±  How to start this project

1. This project comes with the necessary files to start working, but you have two options to start:

a) Click on this link to open it with Gitpod (recommended): https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-conditional-profile-card.git

b) If you don't have Gitpod, you can clone this repository on your local computer:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-conditional-profile-card.git
````

2. Get into the project folder: 

`cd exercise-conditional-profile-card`

3. Install NPM packages: `npm install`

Note: if you're using c9 make sure you are running in the latest version of node: 

4. Build for the first time: `npm run start`

5. Start updating the `render` function inside the `app.js` file.

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## Some context

As a web developer, you will be creatings lots and lots of dynamic HTML using Javascript based algorithms.

In this exercise you have to create the HTML code needed to render a profile card based on a series of variables that could change in value during runtime. Here is an example of the profile card:

![Conditional Profile Card](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-conditional-profile-card/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

Inside the src/app.js file there is a `render` function that receives variables and contains the logic to create most of the website HTML code.

```js
function render(variables = {}) {
  document.querySelector("#widget_content").innerHTML = `<div>Website code</div>`;
}
```

You can see the `variables` that are being generated by typing on the developer console: 

```js
console.log(window.variables);
/*
{
    includeCover: true, // if includeCover is true the algorithm should
    background: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511974035430-5de47d3b95da", // this is the url of the image that will used as background for the profile cover
    avatarURL: "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/42.jpg", // this is the url for the profile avatar
    socialMediaPosition: "left", // social media bar position (left or right)
    
    twitter: null, // social media usernames
    github: "alesanchezr",
    linkedin: null,
    instagram: null,

    name: null,
    lastname: null,
    role: null,
    country: null,
    city: null
}
*/
````

## üìùInstructions

These instructions come with a video for better understanding: https://youtu.be/gaVm8eyCqlM

1. Read and understand the render function and the value of the `variables` variable that it receives.
2. Change the content of the render function to make it render the variables on the card.

## Initial Variable Values

| Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| includeCover | boolean | true | it determines if the cover shoud be visible with an image or not |
| background | string | null | the url of the image that will used as background for the profile cover |
| avatarURL | string | null | the url for the profile avatar |

## Hard-Coded HTML

This is an example of a possible HTML output, you will have to replace the name, lastname, etc. With the values that these variables may have.
```html
<div class="widget">
  <div class="cover"><img src="https://the_url.com/for_the_background.png" /></div>
  <img src="https://the_url.com/for_the_image.png" class="photo" />
